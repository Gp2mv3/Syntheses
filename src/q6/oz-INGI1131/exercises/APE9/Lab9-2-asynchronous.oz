%%% SECOND IMPLEMENTATION - Asynchronous
% Now the server poll each student but doesn't wait for his reply.
% It gives the student a callback Port where they have to send their
% reply. Charlotte doesn't know or care about the order of the replies
% so this works fine.
%
% The port function only needs to wait until AskLoop has sent
% a message to every student because PortLoop needs NumberOfStudent
% to be bound so it can stop and return its result when every student replied.
% This is ok because AskLoop shouldn't take much time since no calculation is done there
% If Send calls tooks time, we could still write 'NumberOfStudents={Length University}
% instead of letting AskLoop compute that.
