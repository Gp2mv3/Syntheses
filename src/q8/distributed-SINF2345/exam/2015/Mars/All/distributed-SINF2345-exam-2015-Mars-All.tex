\section{(Fault tolerance hierarchy) Define precisely omission failures
and crash-recovery failures. Then demonstrate why omission is a special case of
crash-recovery.}

\section{(Causality and vector clocks) Define the causal order between events
and the implementation of vector clocks. Then explain the relationship between
vector clocks and causal order.}

\section{(Uniform eager reliable broadcast) Give the implementation of a uniform
eager reliable broadcast algorithm for the fail-silent model. Explain why the
technique of majority acknowledgment is correct. How does the majority condition
guarantee uniformity?}
