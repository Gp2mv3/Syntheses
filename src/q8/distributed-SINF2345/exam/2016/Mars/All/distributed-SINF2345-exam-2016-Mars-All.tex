\section{Class problems}
Define, as precisely as you can, what is a total broadcast algorithm and what is
a consensus algorithm. Outline the proof that a consensus algorithm can be
solved with the solution of the total broadcast algorithm.

\section{Partially synchronous system}
Define what is a partially synchronous system. Define what does an algorithm
that works on a partially synchronous system. Why can we say the Internet is
a partially synchronous system ?

\section{Point-to-point link}
Given a perfect point-to-point link, define an abstraction that implements a perfect FIFO point-to-point link, i.e., messages from the same source process to the same destination process arrive in the same order as they are sent.  Define the interface of the abstraction (requests and indications) and the implementation (give pseudocode, using the notation of the course).  Hint: the algorithm should number messages, collect them with their numbers for a given source node, and deliver them in order of their numbers with no gaps.
