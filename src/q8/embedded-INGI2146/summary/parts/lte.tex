\section{LTE}
Long Term Evolution (4G), performance:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Up to 300 Mbit/s downlink, 75Mbit/s uplink
	\item 5-20ms latency
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Origin}
It is expected that performance in UMTS has reached it limits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Higher transfer rates would have required higher chip
	rate $\to$ shorter chip duration $\to$ more sensitive to
	multipath fading
	\item Latency in UMTS still highn partially because of old
	design (GPRS based network)
\end{itemize}
LTE is a complete redesign, its a simplified IP-only network with
gateways to other networks.

\subsection{Radio Interface}
LTE use a completely new radio interface called OFDM and SC-FDMA

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Downlink}: Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
        (OFDM)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Data is distributed over a large number (up to 1200) of 15 kHz
                space orthogonal subcarriers

            \item Subcarriers are orthogonal if the maximum amplitude of one subcarrier
        is reached while the other subcarriers amplitude is zero	
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{description}
                \proitem{} More robust against interferences that affect only a 
                few subcarriers.

            \consitem{} More coding work, power consumption increases
                with number of subcarriers (does'nt matter for base station)

        \end{description}

    \item \textbf{Uplink}:  Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Comparable to OFDM, but data is preprocessed in a wat that 
                Peak-To-Average-Power Ration of the signal is smaller than with 
                OFDM

                \proitem{} More energy-efficient
                \consitem{} but lower uplink rate
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Category and Bearer}
User equipment are category and depending on their category 
different aspect in transmission will change: modulation, peak data rate,MIMO,\ldots\\
UE request different bearer to specify its traffic requirements of application (QoS)

\subsubsection{eNodeB}
\begin{itemize}
    \item eNodeB = evolved Node B, does the job of 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item BTS, BSC for GSM
            \item Node B and RNC for UMTS
        \end{itemize}
    \item eNodeB can directly communicate with each other:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Interference coordination] UE reports signal measurements from neighbor 
                cells to its eNodeB; the node can contact the eNodeB of those cells
            \item[Handover] eNodeB can decide and prepare handover 
                (without involvement of an MSC in GSM)
        \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data transfer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P-GW}: An UE gets an IP address assigned by the P-GW
        in the moment it connects to the LTE network.
        \begin{description}
            \item[Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW):] Connects to the Internet
                or Intranets of large companies
        \end{description}

    \item \textbf{S-GW}: Incoming Internet traffic is tunneled from the P-GW
        to the S-GW and then to the eNodeB of the UE.

        \begin{description}
            \item[S-GW(Servicing Gateway):] Responsible for several eNodeB
        \end{description}

    \item \textbf{MME}: Mobility Management Entity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Authentication
            \item Establishing tunnels and modifyinh them if handover
            \item Helping to handover if two eNodeB cannot communicate to each other
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LTE Advanced}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Up to 1Gbit/s downlink
	\item Pico and Femto cells for crowded areas
	\item Carrier bundling
	\item 4x8 MIMO

\end{itemize}
