\section{Describe and compare the different types of training and
documentation with respect to different types of user.}


\subsection{Training}

\begin{itemize}
        
\item Types of users:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users: Exercise the main system functions (create, edit, analyse data, draw graphs, communicate,\ldots)
    \item Operators: Perform supplementary functions (create back up copies of data files, define who has access to the system,\ldots)
\end{itemize}

\item User training:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on primary functions
        \subitem{} Data creation, deletion, sorting etc\ldots
        \subitem{} Navigation through the system
    \item Focus on the what, not the how (no mention of internal structures and algorithms)
        \subitem{} No mention of internal structure
    \item Relate to how the functions were performed before the new system
\end{itemize}

\item Operator training:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on support functions
        \subitem{} System configuration, start up, shutdown etc\ldots
    \item Focus on the how, not the what (how the system works, internal structures)
\end{itemize}

\item Different types of training:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial training (complete training at system delivery)
    \item Later training (complete training for new users)
    \item Brush up training (review training on selected features)
    \item Infrequent user training (only basic functions)
    \item Specialized training (specific function)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Guideline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Match the needs and capabilities of the student
        \item Individualized systems ($\neq$ trainings for
            $\neq$ student)
        \item Presentation unit (shorts sessions better than a
            few long one)
            \item Location (students in many places)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Types of users:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users: Primary functions
    \item Operators: Support function
    \item Customer staff: General description
    \item Development team: Implementation details
\end{itemize}

\item Types of documentations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item User’s manual
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Start with general purpose
            \item Progress to detailed functional description (manual, focus on how to use)
            \item User friendly, colours, glossary etc\ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \item Operator’s manual
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Globally the same as previous
            \item Additional advanced functions details (back up, configuration, access, etc\ldots)
        \end{itemize}
    \item General system guide (Customer)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe the solution provided
            \item Hardware and software configuration
            \item Philosophy behind the system’s construction
        \end{itemize}
    \item Programmer guide (maintenance team, extension developers)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe components, functions performed
            \item Support functions (debugging, diagnostics\ldots)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Failure reference guide
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Additional information about exceptions (friendly compare to Blue screen)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Quick reference guide
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
