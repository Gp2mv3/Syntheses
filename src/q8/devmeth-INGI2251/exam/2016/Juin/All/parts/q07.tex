\section{Define software architecture, software units, architectural views.
Describe the following architectural styles: pipes-and-filter,
client-server, peer-to-peer, publish-subscribe, repositories, layering.}

\subsection{Define}

\subsubsection{Software architecture/design}

Software architecture refers to the high level structures of a software
system. We now focus on the HOW to implement the customer's requirement
(not on the WHAT). The system's architecture is structural, systemic and
hard to change.

\paragraph{Sources of design}

\paragraph{The design process}

    \caption{The design process}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Software units}

Architecture design decomposes the system into software units (depending on
aspects considered):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Components
    \item Classes
    \item Subsystems
    \item Packages
    \item Runtime processes
    \item Libraries
    \item Modules
    \item Procedures
\end{itemize}


A design is modular when each activity of the system is performed by exactly one
software unit (the inputs and outputs of each software unit are well-defined).

A software unit is well-defined when its externally visible behaviour is
precisely specified.

\subsubsection{Architectural views}

In addition to decompose the system in software units, the system could be
analysed with different architectural views. Common types of architectural views:

\begin{description}
    \item[Decomposition view (traditional view)] portrays the system as
    programmable units (typically a hierarchy of models)
    \item[Dependencies view] shows dependencies among software units (useful in
    project planning)
    \item[Generalization view] shows software units that are generalizations or
    specializations of one another (useful when designing abstract or extendible
    software units)
    \item[Execution view] shows the runtime structure of a system in terms of
    its components and connectors (the traditional box-and-arrow diagram)
    \item[Implementation view] maps software units to source files (helps
    programmers find implementations)
    \item[Deployment view] maps runtime entities to computer resources (helps
    the architect analyse the quality attributes)
    \item[Work-assignment view] decomposes the design into work tasks (helps
    project managers to plan and allocate project resources and to track each
    team's progress)
\end{description}


\subsection{Architectural styles}

\subsubsection{Pipes-and-filter}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{pipes_and_filter.png}
    \caption{Pipes and filter}
\end{figure}

In a pipe-and-filter style, system functionality is achieved by passing input
data through a sequence of data-transforming components, called filters, to
produce output data. Pipes are connectors that simply transmit data from one
filter to the next without modifying the data.

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Reason by functional composition
    \proitem{} Filters can be reused easily
    \proitem{} Easy evolution: add, replace, remove filters
    \proitem{} Allow concurrent execution of filters
    \proitem{} Compositional throughput analysis
    \consitem{} Overhead of parsing inputs, producing outputs
    \consitem{} Batch processing, not good for interactive
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Client-server}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \footnotesize
    \input{res/client_server}
    \caption{Client-server architecture}
\end{figure}

Servers offer services and clients access them using a request/reply protocol.
Note that clients know servers but servers don't know clients.

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Can distribute servers among processors $\rightarrow$ improve
    performance
    \proitem{} Servers can be layered (multitier)
    \proitem{} Supports reuse of servers across applications
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Peer-to-peer (P2P)}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{scriptsize}
        \input{res/peer_to_peer}
    \end{scriptsize}
    \caption{Peer-to-peer architecture}
\end{figure}

All components are peers (equals), they execute concurrently and act as both
clients and servers (i.e.\ specify both provided and requested services).
\newline
In other words, any component can call any component.

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Scale up well
    \proitem{} Increased system capabilities (replication)
    \proitem{} Highly tolerant of failures (replication)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Publish-subscribe}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{publish_suscribe.png}
    \caption{Publish-subscribe architecture}
\end{figure}

Subscribers subscribe to events from a server (bus) by registering a callback
(implicit invocation). Publishers publish (broadcast) events to the server
(bus). Registered subscribers receive the events (the server calls the
callback).\newline
Note that publishers and subscribers don't know each other (all know the server
and the events).

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Easy evolution, customization, reuse
    \consitem{} Need shared repository for shared persistent data
    \consitem{} Difficult to test
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Repositories}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{repositories.png}
    \caption{Repositories architecture}
\end{figure}

A repository style of architecture consists of two types of components: a
central data store and associated data-accessing components. 
Shared data are
stockpiled in the data store, and the data accessors are computational units
that store, retrieve, and update the information. \newline

In a traditional database, components are active (clients) and data store is
reactive. In the blackboard type of repository, blackboard (data store) is
active and knowledge sources (components) are reactive.

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Centralized management of data
    \proitem{} Improve performance (distribute)
    \consitem{} More complex, consistency, security (distribute)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Layering}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{layering.png}
    \caption{Layering architecture}
\end{figure}

Layered systems organize the systemâ€™s software units into layers, each of which
provides services to the layer above it and acts as a client to the layer below.
We can thus say that each layer raises the level of abstraction.

\begin{itemize}
    \proitem{} Relatively easy to add or modify a layer
    \proitem{} Porting on different platforms
    \consitem{} Not applicable to all systems
    \consitem{} System performance may suffer extra coordination among layers
\end{itemize}
