\section{Explain the goals and principles of software testing. Describe the
different stages of a software testing process, from unit to installation.
Discuss the different types of faults. Define and compare white-box and
black-box testing.}


\subsection{Software testing}
The goal of software testing is to discover faults and not to demonstrate correctness,
In other words a test is successful when a fault is discovered. \newline
When a fault is discovered, we identify the fault (what fault caused the failure) and correct it
(making changes to remove the fault).

\subsection{Stages of a software testing process}

\end{figure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Unit test (aka.\ module test, component test)]
    Each program component.
    \item[Integration test]
    Assemble components together and check correct interaction.
    \item[Function test]
    The whole system.
    Check that the behaviour conforms to functional requirement specifications.
    \item[Performance test]
    The whole system.
    Check that the behaviour conforms to nonfunctional requirement specifications.
    \item[Acceptance test]
    The whole system.
    Test using the system with the customer.
    Check that the behaviour conforms to (customer) requirement documentation.
    \item[Installation test]
    The system in its operational environment.
    Check that the system performs properly in its environment.
\end{description}


\subsection{Types of faults}

\begin{description}
    \item[Algorithmic faults] the program logic produces a wrong computation
    \item[Computation and precision faults] a mathematical computation is wrong or the
    result does not have the required precision
    \item[Timing or coordination faults] incorrect event timing or coordination (real-time
    systems)
    \item[Documentation faults] documentation doesn't match what program does
    \item[Throughput or performance faults] system's performance not acceptable
    \item[Capacity or boundary faults] System's performance not acceptable when activity
    increases
    \item[Hardware and system software faults] supplied hardware or system software does
    not work as specified
    \item[Standard and procedure faults] coding standards and procedures not respected
\end{description}

\subsection{White-box and black-box testing}

\paragraph{Black box (or closed box)}

Content is unknown or ignored. \newline
Test input/output behaviour (functional).

\begin{itemize}
    \item[+] Not constrained by the structure of the unit under test
    \item[-] Impossible to know whether a test is complete
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{White box (or clear box)}

Content is visible and observed. \newline
Test internal operation (structural).

\begin{itemize}
    \item[+] Can check that program elements are tested
\end{itemize}
