\section{(Safety and liveness) Give completely precise definitions of safety
and liveness, in terms of the possible executions of a system. Your definitions
can be given with natural language and/or diagrams, as long as they are
precise!}

\nosolution

\section{(Problem reduction) Explain why the \enquote{X reduces to Y} relation
is a \enquote{pre-order} and not a \enquote{partial order}. Give an example
to show the difference.}

\nosolution

\section{(The concet of \enquote{rounds}) Define the technique of
\enquote{rounds} which is used by some distributed algorithms. How can a
distributed algorithm work correctly in rounds iif each node advances its round
number separately (since there is no guarantee that the rounds will advance
at exactly the same time on different nodes)? Give a code fragment to show
how this works in a consensus algorithm.}

\nosolution

\section{(Uniform reliable FIFO broadcast) First give the specification of
FIFO order. Then assume that you have a uniform reliable broadcast algorithm
(you do not have to write the code for this algorithm). Now using this
algorithm, write the complete code for a uniform reliable FIFO (not causal!)
broadcast algorithm.}
