\section{(Perfect FIFO point-to-point link) Given a perfect point-to-point link,
define an abstraction that implements a perfect FIFO point-to-point link. Define
the interface of the abstraction (requests and indications) and the
implementation (give pseudocode, using the notation of the course). Give also
a specification of the single-source FIFO property obeyed by your abstraction.
Be careful not to overspecify your abstraction, i.e. it should obey a FIFO
order but not be forced to obey a causal order.}

\nosolution

\section{(Single storage illusion) Define the concept of a shared register.
Define the properties of sequential consistency and atomicity for shared
registers. Give an example execution that obeys sequential consistency but is
not atomic.}

\nosolution

\section{(Equivalence of weak completeness and strong completeness) Define weak
completeness and strong completeness of failure detectors. Explain why they are
equivalent, i.e. give reductions in both directions. Explain why strong and
weak accuracy are not violated in these reductions. This means that we can
restrict our attention to strongly complete failure detectors; we do not have
to consider weakly complete failure detectors.}
