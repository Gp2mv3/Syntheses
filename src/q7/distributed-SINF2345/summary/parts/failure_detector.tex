\section{Failure detectors}

Use failure detectors to encapsulate timing assumptions.
Need completeness and accuracy.

\subsection{Typical implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Periodically exchange \textbf{heartbeat} messages
    \item Timeout based on worst case RTT
    \item if timeout, then suspect node
    \item if rcv msg from suspected node then revise suspicion and
        increase time-out
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modeling}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration = state of each node + \textcolor{red}{FD\_state of each
        node}
    \item Transition function on node $i$ gets extra parameter:
        \textcolor{red}{FD\_state of node $i$}
    \item FD\_state updated in $comp(i)$ by \textcolor{red}{FD\_function}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completeness (regarding actually crashed nodes)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Strong: Every crashed node is eventually detected by \textbf{all}
            correct nodes

            \textit{There exists a time after which all crashed
            nodes are detected by all correct nodes}

        \item Weak: Every crashed node is eventually detected by \textbf{some}
            correct node

            \textit{There exists a time after which all crashed
            nodes are detected by some correct node}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Accuracy (regarding actually alive nodes)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Strong: No correct node is ever suspected

            \item Weak: There exists a correct node which is never
                suspected by any node

            \item Eventual Strong Accuracy: After some finite time the
                FD provides strong accuracy
            \item Eventual Weak Accuracy: After some finite time the FD
                provides weak accuracy
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Different established detectors}

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|c}
        \toprule
        & & Strong completeness & Weak completeness & Order\\
        \toprule

        \multirow{2}{*}{Synch} & Strong accuracy & Perfect detector (P) &
        Detector (Q) & (1) \\
        & Weak accuracy & Strong detector (S) & Weak detector (W) & (2) \\

        \midrule

        \multirow{2}{*}{Asyn} & Strong accuracy & Eventually perfect detector
        ($\Diamond P$) & Eventually detector Q ($\Diamond Q$) & (3) \\
        & Weak accuracy & Eventually strong detector ($\Diamond S$) & Eventually weak detector
        ($\Diamond W$) & (4) \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{$4 \preceq 3, \quad 4 \preceq 2, \quad 2 \preceq 1, \quad 3
    \preceq 1$}
\end{table}

Weak and strong are equivalent. (Weak equivalence $\preceq$ Strong
equivalence is trivial. The inverse is accomplished by a broadcast of
suspected nodes)

\subsubsection{Perfect detector}

There is only one instruction:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Perfect failure detector}, mathescape, captionpos=b]
indication <crash | $p_i$>
\end{lstlisting}

There are two properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PFD1 \textbf{Strong completeness}: every crashed node is eventually
    detected by \textbf{all} correct nodes
    \item PDF2 \textbf{Strong accuracy}: no correct node is ever suspected
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each node every $\gamma$ time: \texttt{Send <heartbeat>} to all nodes
    \item If don't receive \texttt{<heartbeat>} from node $p_i$ after $\delta + \gamma$ time:
    \texttt{Detect <crash | $p_i$>}
\end{enumerate}

$\Rightarrow$ Synchronous system

\subsubsection{Eventually perfect detector ($\Diamond P$)}:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Eventually Perfect detector}, mathescape, captionpos=b]
indication <suspect | $p_i$>
indication <restore | $p_i$>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each node every $\gamma$ time: \texttt{Send <heartbeat>} to all nodes
    \item If don't receive \texttt{<heartbeat>} from node $p_i$ after $T$ time:
    \texttt{Send <suspect | $p_i$>} and add $p_i$ in suspected set
    \item If receive \texttt{<heartbeat>} from node $\in$ suspected:
    \texttt{<restore | $p_i$>} and remove from suspected
\end{enumerate}

$\Rightarrow$ Partially synchronous system
