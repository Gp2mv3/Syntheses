\section{(4,5 points)}
A ground station is emitting a plane wave toward a satellite, with an elevation angle $\alpha_1=10^o$. The electric field is horizontally polarized. The atmosphere is modelled as two dielectric layers separated by a horizontal interface. The relative dielectric permittivity of the two layers is $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2 = 1.01\epsilon_1$ respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (1 point) Calculate the elevation angle in layer 2 ($\alpha_2$ in the figure).
    \item (2 point) Calculate the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ and the transmission coefficient $T$ of the electric field at the interface between the two layers.
    \item (1,5 points) If the distance between the satellite and the ground station (Matera) is \SI{40500}{km} and the frequency \SI{7.8}{GHz}, calculate the free space losses + total tropospheric losses exceeded during 0.01\% of the time.
\end{enumerate}
(CCDF graph available with an attenuation of \SI{9}{dB} for 0.01\% of the time at the angle and frequency related to this problem)

\section{(4,5 points)}

Two parabolic dish antennas are facing each other to establish a horizontal link over a distance of \SI{2}{km}. The frequency of operation is \SI{5}{GHz} and the diameter of the dishes is 1 meter. Both antennas have an input impedance of \SI{50}{\ohm}, while the generator impedance is $(100-j50)$ Ohm on the transmitting side and the receiver impedance is \SI{50}{\ohm} on the receiving side. The noise figure of the receiver is \SI{3}{dB}, the bandwidth of the signal is \SI{5}{MHz}. The transmitting polarization is vertical, while the receiving polarization is circular. \SI{10}{mW} are available at the generator.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assuming in a first instance that the two antennas have the same polarization and that they are impedance matched, what is the signal-to-noise ratio on the receiver?
    \item What does that SNR become with the impedance and polarization mismatches referred to above?
    \item With which accuracy (in degrees) do the two antennas need to be pointed at each other to avoid a decrease of the signal by more than \SI{3}{dB}? (do the calculation assuming that one antenna is perfectly pointed and the other is not)
\end{enumerate}

\section{(4,5 points)}

We consider the downlink of a cellular transmission \SI{3.5}{GHz}, using a bandwidth of \SI{5}{MHz} per user. At the base station, the transmit power is 20 W and the antenna gain is \SI{5}{dBi}. For the considered environment, the path-loss is given in [\si{dB}] by:
\[ P_L [\si{dB}] = 140 + 10 \gamma \log_{10}(d) + S_{\si{dB}} \]
where $d$ is the distance in km from the base station , $\gamma = 3$ is the pass-loss exponent and $S_{\si{dB}}$ is the log-normal shadowing: $S_{\si{dB}}$ is a zero-mean Gaussian variable with a standard deviation of \SI{6}{dB}.
The mobile terminal is characterized by a quasi-omnidirectional antenna of \SI{2}{dBi} gain and a noise spectral density of \SI{1.9e-19}{mW/Hz}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What should be the cell radius $R$ in order to guarantee that the average received power is at least \SI{-100}{dBm} over the entire cell?
    \item What is therefore the average SNR (received power to noise power ratio) at the cell edge (i.e. at a distance $d=R$)?
    \item What is the probability that the received power falls bellow \SI{-114}{dBm} at the cell edge?
    \item Assuming hexagonal cells, at which distance can the network operator re-use the same frequency to maintain a Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) of \SI{18}{dB} (neglecting thermal noise)? What is in this case the cell pattern (i.e. the number of available frequencies)?
    \item If the channel consists in two multi-paths of equal amplitude, what is the maximum separation in delay that could still guarantee flat-fading transmission? Is this realistic in urban areas?
\end{enumerate}
