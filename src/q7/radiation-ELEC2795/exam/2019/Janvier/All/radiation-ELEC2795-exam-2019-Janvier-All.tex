\begin{enumerate}
    \item (1 point) Calculate the reflection coefficient at $z=0$.
    \item (1 point) Calculate the smallest value of $L$ such that there is total transmission at $z=0$ (in mm).
    \item (2,5 points) Assume that the frequency is not exactly at \SI{75}{GHz}, calculate the percentage of reflected power.
    Consider the frequency equal to $f=f_0(1+\delta)$ and develop to the first order of $\delta$.
    
    Hint: use $\sin(\pi+\epsilon)=-\sin(\epsilon)\approx-\epsilon$ and $\cos(\pi+\epsilon) \approx -1$ for $\epsilon \to 0$.

\section{(4,5 points)}

A wireless horizontal link is established over a 100 meter distance at \SI{2.4}{GHz}. In first instance, we will assume that the antennas are placed high enough to be able to omit the effect of interaction with the ground. On the transmit side, the antenna is actually made of an array of two parallel half-wave dipoles, oriented perpendicularly to the ground and spaced by half a wavelength. The power fed to the pair of antennas is assumed to be split equally between the antennas, and the matching at the common feeding part is supposed perfect. On the receiving side, an antenna with circular polarization, with a 10 dB gain is used. The antenna is correctly pointed and its pattern falls off by 3 dB at an angle close to 25 degrees from boresight. That antenna is badly matched: it has an impedance of $100-20\imagj \Omega$, while the receiver has \SI{50}{\Omega} input impedance. Its noise figure is also relatively bad, corresponding to 4 dB. The transmitted array is not well pointed towards the receiving antenna, because of non-equal phases in the two excitations, such that the pattern is actually pointing 20 degrees away from the line of sight. The noise contributed by the environment will be calculated assuming a \SI{290}{K} temperature in all directions and the occupied bandwidth is \SI{20}{MHz}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (4 points) Considering \SI{1}{mV} for the transmitting power, what is the SNR (in dB) observed at the receiver?
    \item (0,5 points) Please try to provide a rough estimate for an upper bound (in dB) of the (significant) effect of reflection on the ground, considering that the heights of the antennas above the ground are 20 meters.

Wireless transmission QPSK between 1 TX and 2 RX. The signal at antenna $i$ (1 or 2) is 
\[                                                                                    
    y_i(t)=h_i\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} I_nu(t-nT)+w_i(t)
\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_i$ is the fading coefficient between Rx and Tx;
    \item $I_n$ is the complex symbol sent at instant $nT$;
    \item $u(t)$ is the transmit filter;
    \item $w_i(t)$ is the complex envelope of the AWGN corrupting the signal, with bandpass power spectral density $\frac{N_i}{2}$. The noise between different Rx is uncorrelated.
\end{itemize}
We consider the detection operation to be performed by containing the two signals $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ to recover the transmitted data. We first apply a matched filter operation on signals $y_i(t)$ with a filter having impulse response $u^*(-t)$, and we sample the output at positions $mT$. This produces samples $y'_i[m]=h_iI_m\epsilon_u+w'_i[m]$ where $\epsilon_u$ is the energy contained in $u(t)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assuming first that $\frac{N_i}{2}=\frac{N_0}{2}$ for all $i$, (3 points)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the decision rule corresponding to the ML estimate of $I_m$ based on both $y'_1[m]$ and $y'_2[m]$? Remark: don't forget $I_m$ is complex. Hint: find the ML estimate for the real part and the imaginary part.
        \item What can you say about the SNR of the decision variables? Comment please.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let us consider that all $N_i$ can be different (1,5 points),
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recalculate the ML decision rule for the data. 
        
        Hint: multiply each $y'[m]$ by a well-chosen term in order to obtain noise terms with equal variance.
        \item What can you say about the SNR of the decision variables compared to the SNR associated with each receive antenna? Comment please. What happens when for instance $N_1$ is much larger than $N_2$.

 \item 
If we consider a Ricean fading channel described
\begin{itemize}
    \item by a dominant multipath with a specific angle-of-arrival
    \item by a Rayleigh made of a large number of multipath arriving at the mobile terminal in the horizontal plane from all directions in azimuth.
\end{itemize}
In that case, the Doppler spectrum is given by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the so-called Jakes spectrum defined by 
    \[
     (v) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
                  \frac{3}{2 \pi v_m \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{v_m^2}}} & \textrm{for} &  \abs{v} < v_m \\
                  0 & \textrm{for} & \abs{v} \ge v_m
                  \end{array} \right.
    \]
    where $v_m$ is the maximum Doppler shift.
    \item a weighted combination of the Jakes spectrum and a delta function at the origin

In a hexadecimal cellular network characterized by a path-loss exponent equal to 3, a signal to interference ratio of 10 dB is targeted. The frequency reuse pattern must be based on at least 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 4 Cells

        \item a path-loss exponent equal to 4
        \item a path-loss exponent lower than 2
    \end{enumerate}
    
\item
