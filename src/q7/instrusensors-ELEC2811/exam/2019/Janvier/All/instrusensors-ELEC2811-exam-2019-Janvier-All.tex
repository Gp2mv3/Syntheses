\end{figure}

For each statement, select true or false: 100 \% for a right answer, 0 \% for no answer and $-50$ \% for a wrong answer.

\begin{itemize}
    \item When $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are capacitors and $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ are resistors, it is a high pass filter.
    \item The gain depends on the impedances $Z_1$ to $Z_4$.
    \item This filter is always used for sensors with a changing resistance.
    \item The Sallen--Key filter is considered as a second order filter.
\end{itemize}

    \item No idea 
    \item True
  \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

    \item The relation between the capacitance and the stimulus is always linear in a capacitor with parallel plates.
    \item The measurement of the water level in a tank with a variable capacitor must come with a temperature measurement.
    \item A capacitor has a linear relation with humidity.

  \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\section{}

A team of engineers is asked to measure leakages of hydrogen in order to estimate the risk of explosion. Leakage of hydrogen becomes dangerous when the concentration in air reaches 4 \% since it associates with oxygen and it results in an explosion.  The hydrogen is stored in a room where other bottles of gases can be placed, mostly carbon monoxide and ammonia. 

Do you recommend them to use the MOX gas sensor for their project? Give arguments based on the characteristic below (sensitivity, offset, calibration, selectivity, limit of concentration) and the working of the MOX gas sensor.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{quest7.png}
    \caption{Characteristic of the MOX gas sensor}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
  $$4\% = 4000\ ppm$$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sensitivity: $0.015\ [R_s/R_d/ppm] $
    \item offset: $1.015\ [R_s/R_d]$
    \item calibration: easy to calibrate (line)
    \item selectivity: mix with CO (at 100 ppm) and with amonia (at 1 ppm)
    \item limit of concentration: out of the span for the hydrogen
  \end{itemize}
  To low $R_s/R_d$ for 4\%
\end{solution}

         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

  \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

    \item The amplitude distribution of the white noise is:
    \begin{center}
        gaussian - constant
        \end{center}

\section{}
HDR CMOS images: resolution enhancement.

We aim to use resolution enhancement on dark and bright pixels to improve the quality of our image, explain how you would achieve this.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{quest13.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}

  We use the exposure time as a degree of freedom. We take multiple images with different exposure times to have a good resolution for each pixel

\end{solution}

\section{}

A periodic noise signal of frequency 50 Hz is added on the signal to detect, which is sampled at 500 S/s. How can you reduce this noise with a digital filter? Which filter is the best for this application? Why? Explain how it works.

\begin{solution}
  We use a band reject filter (a low pass filter and a high pass filter) to reject the 50 Hz frequency
  $$y[n] = x[n] * (h_1[n] + h_2[n]) $$ 

\end{solution}

\section{Question about the project}

We had to take the height of the liquid in the glass into account, which was not the case during the project.

We suppose we stay at constant ambient weather conditions, s.t. the temperature and relative humidity don't have to be taken into account. We use the same glass of height $h_{\textnormal{glass}} = 15$ cm.
\[
    R_s = R_0 \left[1-\alpha \left(\frac{h_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{h_{\textnormal{glass}}}\right)^2\right]\,.
\]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
    Type & $ \alpha $ \\
    \hline
     Maes Raedler & 0.1 \\
     \hline
     Jupiler & 0.4 \\
     \hline
     Taras Boulba & 0.5 \\
     \hline
     Grimbergen & 0.7 \\
     \hline 
     Rochefort & 0.9 \\
     \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

First, we suppose that we serve each drink, at the same height and in the same type of glass.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $R_0$ has an unknown value between 0.1 and 150 k$\Omega$. Gain sensitivity $0.1$ mV$/\Omega$. The addition of white noise, quantization error, device-to-device variation, etc. is resumed in an overall amplitude error of $0.2$ mV. Compute the minimum height of liquid $h_{\textnormal{liquid}}$ in order to be able to separate the Jupiler from the Taras Boulba.

    Now, we want to remove the need of having the same height of liquid for the different drinks. But we still assume it varies in a span from 80 mm to 120 mm.
    
    \item Knowing the distance $d=h_{\textnormal{glass}} - h_{\textnormal{liquid}}$, explain how you could introduce it in your project.
    Start by giving a summary of your actual system, your whole system.
    
    \item 
    
    \item Give a sensor that could be used to measure this distance.
    
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We want $|V_{TB} - V_{J}| > 0.4\ [mV]$ to have margin for the error

      $$R_J - R_{TB} > \frac{0.4}{0.1} = 4\ [\Omega]$$
      i$$R_0(\alpha_{TB} - \alpha_J)\left(\frac{h_{\text{liquid}}}{h_{\text{glass}}}\right)^2 > 4$$
      $$h_{\text{liquid}} > h_{\text{glass}} \sqrt{\frac{4}{100*0.1}} = 9.5\ [cm] $$
    \item We can use a capacitive sensor to measure the distance.
  \end{itemize}
\end{solution}
